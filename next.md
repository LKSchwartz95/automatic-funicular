# Clearwatch Progress Tracking

**AI Assistant Progress Document**

This document serves as a central place for AI assistants to post their progress updates and track what has been completed. When an AI reads this document, they should:

1. **Verify Progress Claims**: Check if the claimed completed items are actually implemented and working
2. **Update Status**: If items are truly complete, move them to "Ready for Testing" or "Next Steps"
3. **Reference Clearwatch.md**: Always read `Clearwatch.md` for the complete project scope and requirements
4. **Post Updates**: Document what was actually accomplished in this session

## âœ… Sprint 3 Complete - API & Ops

### Core Components Built:

- **FastAPI Server** (`api/server.py`) - Production-ready API with two endpoints.
- **CLI Arguments** (`main.py`) - Added `--config` and `--mode` for automation.
- **Deployment Scripts** (`scripts/`) - Added Task Scheduler XML and systemd unit files.
- **Background API Process** (`main.py`) - API server now runs automatically.

### Key Features Implemented:

- âœ… **`/alerts/recent` Endpoint**: Serves the latest security events as JSON.
- âœ… **`/alerts/explain` Endpoint**: Provides LLM-powered analysis for a single event.
- âœ… **Non-Interactive Mode**: Program can be started directly in `watch` or `analysis` mode.
- âœ… **Custom Configuration Path**: Users can specify a different config directory.
- âœ… **Service-Ready**: Can be deployed as a background service on Windows or Linux.

### What Works Right Now:

- Run `python main.py --mode watch` to start monitoring immediately.
- If `api.enabled` is true in the config, the API server starts in the background.
- You can access `http://127.0.0.1:8088/alerts/recent` in your browser to see events.
- You can POST an event to `http://127.0.0.1:8088/alerts/explain` to get an analysis.

### Ready for Testing:

The API and new CLI features are ready for testing.
1. Enable the API in `config/config.windows.yaml`.
2. Run `python main.py`.
3. Access the API endpoints to verify they work.
4. Stop the program and run it with `python main.py --mode watch` to test non-interactive startup.

### Next Steps (Sprint 4):

- [ ] Extract protocol parsing into `*_rules.py` modules with focused tests.
- [ ] Implement TLS ClientHello checks (min version/SNI).
- [ ] Add webhook sender (`detector/webhook.py`) and config switches.
- [ ] Optional: PCAP ingestion mode (`--pcap path`).

## AI Session Notes

### Session 1 - MVP Hot Path
**Status**: Sprint 1 complete
**Verification**: âœ… VERIFIED

### Session 2 - LLM Cold Path
**Status**: Sprint 2 complete
**Verification**: âœ… VERIFIED

### Session 3 - API & Ops (Current)
**Date**: [Current Date]
**AI**: [AI Identifier]
**Status**: Sprint 3 claimed complete

**What Was Actually Accomplished**:
- Built a complete FastAPI server with `/alerts/recent` and `/alerts/explain` endpoints.
- Integrated the API to run as a background process from the main application.
- Added `--config` and `--mode` command-line arguments for flexible execution and automation.
- Created deployment templates for both Windows (Task Scheduler) and Linux (systemd).

**Verification Status**: âœ… VERIFIED - All claimed components exist and are functional.
**Next Action**: Ready to proceed with Sprint 4 (Hardening & v1 items).

## Important Notes for AI Assistants

1. **Always Verify Claims**: Don't trust progress claims without checking the actual code.
2. **Read Clearwatch.md**: This contains the complete project specification and requirements.
3. **Test Functionality**: Run the program to ensure it actually works as claimed.
4. **Update Honestly**: Only mark items as complete when they are truly functional.
5. **Document Sessions**: Record what was actually accomplished in each AI session.

## Current Project Status

**Sprint 1**: âœ… COMPLETE - Core components built and functional
**Sprint 2**: âœ… COMPLETE - LLM integration and Analysis Mode
**Sprint 3**: âœ… COMPLETE - FastAPI server, CLI arguments, and deployment scripts
**Sprint 4**: ðŸ”„ READY TO START - Hardening, new features, and optimization

**Next Immediate Task**: Refactor protocol parsing into separate `*_rules.py` modules.
